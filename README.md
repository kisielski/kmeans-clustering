 Implementation of k-means algorithm

K-means is a clustering algorithm which helps you divide your data into K groups based on data's attributes. This implementation is a 2D version of the algorithm and has different ways of calculating the distance between points:
<ul>
 <li>Euclidean distance</li>
 <li>Chebyshev distance</li>
 <li>Manhattan distance</li>
</ul>
X-means is a version of k-means that does not need value of k on the input. The variation (in this case - sum of distance from the middle of cluster) is calculated in order to find the best k.</br></br>

Examples of the algorithm in action can be found in plots_output directory. There are also a few plots obtained by running x-means on some attributes.</br>
Dataset was obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds.
